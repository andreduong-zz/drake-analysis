Right to Left,Born Successful,2009,"[Intro]
[?]

[Chorus: Drake]
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together moving
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)

[Verse 1: Von Pea]
Yo, what i gotta do to get you pussy cat dogs
To not, act hard like I wouldn't jab y'all
You a trap-star, cool i'm a dream catcher
You from New York, stop biting off Atlanta
Pea is a rap terrorist, suicide bomber
I'ma blow up me and everybody around me
You can't show up pea im everywhere you try to be
Here's some advice get nice and don't lie to me
In my last 6 I trumped your whole shiznik
Son I've heard better MC'ing in limp bizkit
Rappers is rugrats, I am DR. Lipschitz
Come to ya shows theres enough space to park with
Wheres your fanbase, with so much damn grace
I plan your demise over eggs and pancakes
First thought of the day the second one goes
I won't stop until I see TM blow

[Verse 2: T.Dot]
[?]

[Verse 3: Drake]
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus

[Chorus: Drake]
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)

[Verse 4: Drake]
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise"
Forever (Born Successful),Born Successful,2009,"[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man (ever man, ever man)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, man (ever man, ever man, ever man)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shit nigga, this what I does
I swear I ain't lyin', like this is my cubs
This is my club, and I'm dirtied in the summer bitch
Weezy F Baby, always lookin' like I've done some shit
You ain't know nothin' bitch, better know who you fuckin' with
Try to fuck me, I kill you and who you comin' with
No [?], T I had to go stupid
I'm on them high heels and I am no bootsy
Hounds Avenue, ridin' with the Phantom roof gone
The Maybach two-tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24s boy, what are you on?
I'm richer than a bitch without that grey coupon
Yeah, I'm talkin' out of my head
I make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a blood motherfucker, a blood motherfucker
Forever like E T C period motherfucker

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man (ever man, ever man)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, man (ever man, ever man, ever man)

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm so unsigned, it would blow one's mind
'Cause to every single record, I am so unkind
There are no holds barred, there is no love lost
Nigga this that crack, and you know drugs cost so P A Y U P
I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me, never L I E
I got everything I tell 'em I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht
You heard me?
Who else tryna smoke? Yeah nigga, me too
'Cause take my mind off the pressure is what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a Ski-Doo
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down ho, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that Tanner?

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man (ever man, ever man)"
The Winner,Born Successful,2009,"[Verse 1]
I’m performing tonight you know that shit gone be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact
My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trendsetting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
I’m it I’m it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish I'ma wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, Balmain blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

[Verse 2]
Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It’s about time that you made it
I was bumping your songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can’t sign nothing 'til my lawyer get the facts and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it’s not about who you know
It’s just how you balance it
It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
It's how you start actin' when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

[Verse 3]
Uhh, ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in your starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A lot of people sayin' fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Ts
And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band don’t you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us

[Bridge]
And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Sher
I’ll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel, I hope heaven’s prepared for whenever you there

[Verse 4]
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through your stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motherfucking Mario
Yeah and Polo isn’t at my session
It’s the anticipation keeping everybody guessing like

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner"
I Do This,Born Successful,2009,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, shit's all good
The deal got signed, and my split's all good
And these haters pretending that it's all good
Say that shit in person man, I wish y'all would
I'm a motherfuckin' genius, goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed, then the slightest could have fooled me
Yeah, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname's ""Starter Drake""
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen, I could draw attention
But you could tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like

[Chorus: Drake & Belly]
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie (Drake)
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie

[Verse 2: Belly]
Here I go, street reaper
Ballin' over here, we need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house looks something like a resort
You can't resist bein' rich when you record
When this money runs slower than Eeyore
If your life is a movie, you a extra
I'm so fly, I glide: Clyde Drexler (wooh)
Mister pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now, fuck next up

[Chorus: Drake & Belly]
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie"
Fallen,Born Successful,2009,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, it's Drake, KC

[Verse 1: Keshia Chanté]
We was just walking
Just smiling and talking
Then add to my surprise
Got lost in your eyes
This time they were different
And I found what it meant
After I leaned in I helplessly fell in

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love

[Verse 2: Keshia Chanté]
In love and I can't see
What's happening to me
You blinded my thoughts
From what pain and tears taught
See my hearts been broken before
It don't trust love anymore
One kiss from you
I just felt myself fall right through

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love

[Verse 3: Keshia Chanté]
Got me hypnotized with your magic spell
I got butterflies, can't control myself
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you
It's true, don't know what to do

[Bridge: Keshia Chanté & Drake]
Don't stop now
Since I let you in
You showed me how
You showed me how to love again
And there's no reason why
I can't give you a try (you know what it is)
'Cause it feels so right

[Verse 4: Drake]
Look, previously mischievous behavior
Was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some considerable degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But ugh, Keshia, Keshia do you remember the old us?
We would never be together, is what they told us
From immature kids to entrepreneur kids
We bought our own dreams instead of the ones they sold us
Keep it a hundred, what they sayin' I'm a liar for?
Airing laundry, that's what I got a dryer for
What are they even searching through attire for?
Tellin' you these stories bout lonely women that I ignore
Callin' them out is red rover to me
To them it's a dream, its just a rare rover to me
See I'm passionate and focused
I don't know how they expect a Scorpio born in October to be, but ugh

[Alternate Verse: Drake]
I'm going in, check
Look, previously mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But now, I need a culprit
I am talking lofts and beach condo adult shit
I am talking all day shopping sprees at the mall with, friends that I ball with, here meet T's girl, go and get some fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise. I will kill this song until it actually dies
With a military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best until the stats arrive
And all these A-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside, its only slacks and ties
But you dont ever act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy until the plaques arrives
Thats why I love you

[Chorus: Keshia Chanté]
I've fallen please help me"
Do It Now,Born Successful,2009,"[Intro]
Uh, yeah, alright
Uh, well alright
Yeah, well alright
Uh huh, yeah
Feel good

[Verse 1]
It's a celebration, clap-clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscato
For the girl who's a student and her friend who's a model
Finished the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where ya tats is
Show me where ya hands at, maybe I can grasp it
They say if ya get her you can understand her better
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her
Yeah, and I got it together
So when they talk they try deter me it's like whatever
Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself

[Verse 2]
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya
These girl groups with they overprotective managers
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place
Yea... but if you never even been there
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air
I know that shit is exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself"
The Search,Born Successful,2009,"(Saukrates intro)
They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all

[Verse 1: Drake]
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy
Now I'm out in A-Town
They tellin' me Trey sound
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purposeless game
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on

[Drake & Saukrates: Hook]
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all

[Verse 2: Saukrates]
Yeah
Let me show you how to blast up
Now tell me who is a masta
A mind never wasted
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up
See where we from, the 50's are bloody
And the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown, they love me
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of
My lapel, is custom made
You off the rack shit
I'm off the chain, come on
The dogs are loose
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With 40 and Mac Dre
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk
Drake'll give you the deal
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill
Keep on, keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda
Ol' time killin'
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin'
And now the girls like
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin'
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin'
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And  now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold
And keep on, on, on, on, on

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket on my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, uhh, you staying broke
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no one my size
Whatever 40's smokin' 'bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, I'm taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause it's about to go

[Verse 2]
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest, I'mma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-lo

Waving at your girl while she's smiling back at me like"
Man of the Year,Comeback Season,2007,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright

I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Verse 2: Drake]
I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?

I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
(It's The Prince, look here)
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Henessy
Straight with no cubes
Take me where the women be
I won't lose
Drake take Patrón to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? they call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena
I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya

Comeback Season,Comeback Season,2007,"[Produced by Nottz]

[Verse]
I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, ""Is that a rose?""
""You mean Rosé? Why yes it is""
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style, you're in need of ya own, man"
Don’t You Have a Man,Comeback Season,2007,"[Hook: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Drake]
Why you over there lookin at me
While your man standing right beside ya?
The temporary happiness he might provide ya
But you know and I know, that nobody gon do ya like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line of sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly I'm kinda like
""I don't really wanna hit this girl""
And so she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'mma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playin around
It gets deeper and cold-ER, the funny thing is
I'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...

[Hook: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Big Pooh]
Look...we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreat thing
But that was then, you know some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus your man still there, let's be fair
You'll do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past, some late night smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he!
Late night's 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, cause I been the other man
And you NOT gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan
It's my bad, shoulda chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl playin
I'm sayin, you need to do what you do
I'm NOT tryna take it any further with you, C'MON

[Hook: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Phonte]
Uh...uh...I met her at the bar sippin on Patron
And now it's been three years off and on
Cause the same page, we are rarely off and on
Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (c'mon)
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb
But regained it while she was buildin her house a home
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that, she don't know what to do wit her life
Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute she mad at me, next minute it's all good
And I'm in her body like Gray's Anatomy
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (uh)
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, ""Damn, if only her nigga knew"", but...

[Hook: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything"
Intro,Comeback Season,2007,"You see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom
After this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm... what you got?

Comeback"
The Last Hope,Comeback Season,2007,"[Hook: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall

[Hook]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

[Hook]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope"
Think Good Thoughts,Comeback Season,2007,"[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 1: Drake]
They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart, girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart, girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'ma take this hat off, and I'ma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
'Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 2: Phonte]
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping 'bout trapping you's a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, 'cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Yeah, they say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
No El' will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me"
Must Hate Money,Comeback Season,2007,"[Produced by Neenyo]

[Intro]
I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when ""fuck bitches, get money"" was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single

[Hook]
If ya'll dont like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend im just sayin man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin jealous when you paid, savin everything they made, I keep thnkin that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and im whats wrong with the game, but im feelin like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker(so)
I'm in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 (say what)
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the grain and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica
I say 'baby get low', You just getting by
They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply

[Hook]"
Where to Now,Comeback Season,2007,"[Intro: Drake talking]
(Ok, there comes a time) when you gotta be like, you know
I've come this far on my own, done a lot for myself
Where to now you know
But I just, I just tell myself this one thing

[Verse: Drake]
It was worth it, it was all worth it
And by this time I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit but they served they purpose
And I got verses, I got verses
My 16s should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah heartbreak Drake I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna' make all my goals for the future come overnight
God-god-god-god damn how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over watch a season of Flight of the Concords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But uh, tell me you surfin' let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes I swear to God girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Ford's
Ethiopian girl Ethiopian girl
With yo' long curly hair and yo' big ass bootay
Reading all them pro black pro female books
Just let 'em let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription a vision correction
I'm young and successful, I'm living perfection
And mayne if '09 is when I'mma see mine
Being cool ain't enough homie I'mma freeze time
Like that"
Faded,Comeback Season,2007,"[Intro]
Please

[Verse 1: Drake]
D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Something spinnin' fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room, cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian
It's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin ahead (head)
Plus it's gettin hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride y'all
We all of age and I ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb

[Chorus]
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
I just set the 40 ups, and I got two blunts
Bagging sour diesel, stinking like I got a few [?]
I’m sipping on lean, while you got fruit punch
Getting faded like [?], I’ve been wise too much
Man, smoking with the devil got me high as an angel
Blow a smoke ring over my head, it’s a halo
Wake up, and bake up, spend the whole day slow
Head in the clouds, but my face low
Ayo, I got them percocets, you want a percocet?
Yo' girl got some nice titties, yeah, a perky set
I purchase cess ‘cause everyday I work with stress
High while I’m driving, it’s like I’m triyn’ to work a jet
And I smoke like a choo-choo train
So I stay low-key like Ja Rule new name
And I can barely walk, but it’s all good and dandy
Man, I’m so high I need a pilot to land me

[Chorus]
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded

Closer,Comeback Season,2007,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now

[Verse 1: Drake]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like [Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say ""My baby's famous and I knew it"" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out

[Drake Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill

[Hook: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And ""Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest""
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home

[Outro: Drake talking]
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)

Replacement Girl,Comeback Season,2007,"[Intro: Trey Songz]
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement

[Verse 1: Drake & Trey Songz]
Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin' for the good then we got 'em in the trap like, ooh wee
Took 'em from white sneaks to, ooh wee
This metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
Y'all don't really know me if you know me
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that I stayed in
And I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin' at amazin'
Girls tryna SoHo lobby us, hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably us
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town?
Two or three days, I shut you down
Chilin' with the homie Trey Songz, you call him the prince, he rep two up, two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
And I don't ever really kick game, I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providin' that
Understand that I'm worldwide, you get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK and from Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans, but, yo, this hook is for my exes

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ain't ya never seen a youngin' so fly? (Probably not)
Lookin' for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life (She gone)
Tryina find another one tonight
And if it's you baby, let yourself be seen
Don't matter skirts, dresses or jeans
I got that work, know what I mean
And I'm flexin' on my ex if you know what mean

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Verse 3: Drake]
With the other dudes she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin'
Lookin' for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO
Sunshine and that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kellz ain't doin' they thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Let's go"
Easy to Please,Comeback Season,2007,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's

[Hook: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please

[Verse 2: Richie Sosa]
I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, ain't nothin' much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin'
D boys jugglin', single mother strugglin'
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbor's house, I'm on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
But both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
My left arm's like David Wells
My right arm's like Holliday, so I'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
For just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up

[Hook: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please"
Underdog,Comeback Season,2007,"[Intro: Trey Songz]
Yeah Man (Aye)
You already know what it is (Aye)
Trey called Trigga (Aye)
Aye man (Aye)
Show them why you rappin' homie (Aye)
Look

[Hook: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Just copped new shoes
Whip on two two's
Dick down you two
Throw it on YouTube
Tell me what you'd do
If I was to do you
Baby after one time
Sure to make you come back
Back like spinal, stack like dominoes
Catch me out in Mexico
Hasta mañana though, hasta la vista
Chest full of reefer
Rep for my set till the day I meet the Reaper
Petersburg veteran
USA resident
In USA Today it ain't a city I ain't never been
Scared I ain't never been
Yea I ain't never been
Nothing but a underdog
But I'm never under ya'll
Still keep it under there
Right by the underwear
Still in the hood yeah
I ain't talking outerwear
They be moving powder there
Which one of you out of there
Wanna get it
Cause I'm with it
Fuck ya'll, the underdog

[Hook: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

[Verse 2: Drake]
Said I got my city buzzin
You should take a trip and view it
Shout out to Mr.Rogers
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it
And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it ain't a Buick
I never rendezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the fuck you wanna do it
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it
I would say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I fuck with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drop it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
And girl I heard your man a fed, don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city, got 'em open like the lock is gone
Keys out, I ain't talking white though
Baby what you be's 'bout
I mean for tonight hoe
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty

[Hook: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog"
Asthma Team,Comeback Season,2007,"I swear to you Lord
Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between
*Back against the wall like a plasma screens*
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and e'ry night is New Year's
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin'
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And it's cool if you spill suttin it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colour only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin' today
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move, sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm giving away
You feel me?"
The Presentation,Comeback Season,2007,"[Produced By Rich Kidd]

[Verse 1]
Shake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough cloud for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, ""Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?""
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways
Cause I need drug money Who got drug money?
I am talkin ""white Phantom sittin' on dub"" money
I am talkin ""cold champagne at the club"" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb? (dumb)
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
And spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum
I fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from

[Interlude]
Oh! Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity
To formally welcome you to this extravaganza
That I call Comeback Season
Hope you enjoy your stay
Drinks are on me, by the way, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise

[Outro]
Shout out to 40-40

Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world

[Verse: Drake]
Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball

[Hook]
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world"
Bitch Is Crazy,Comeback Season,2007,"[Intro]

You know how I get down
But look I'm just gon keep it real

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup

Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up

Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama (Damn)
You're the only one

And then expect favors (Yea)
When you come in town

Going in for Life,Comeback Season,2007,"I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last 4 shows
I do one song and use four flows
She use to be a Christian before
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me & the salesman build a rapport so
He understands the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash only, transactions homie
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
I been doin this for years homie, thoroughly I thought it
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track admitting most of my Currency’s imported
But too late now, it too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker
Playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A real Menschkeit as they say he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present every regal member
The coalition, is so efficient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Use to record in the basement that rennie grew his piff in
When pops turned over the keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen 'til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, nigga
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I'm equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased is sound vacant
Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talkin bout the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life"
Take Your Girl,Heartbreak Drake,2009,"[Hook 1: Lil Wayne]

She always run back to me saying he's a Dog off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her take a breather
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches
But money's over her Cause money's under nothing
My life is such a blur
It's not the way it has to go, it' just what I prefer
And any Young Money nigga I know would concur
Weezy talk to 'em!

You could get penalized the way you blowin' below the rear
Now this game like a analog I don't sweat cause it show how fake you are
She stressin', ya she testin' ya, she just tryin' to see what kinda level ya on
You don't make it bounce like a basketball, you ain't even get no ass at all
Now you sittin at the club trying to laugh it off, she done found her mid glam boy
You messin up, you messed up, wasn't easy to clean your Mess up
She found me and I blessed her, I applied to her pressure
She call me a professor, I went gave her her lecture

Closer To My Dreams,Heartbreak Drake,2009,"[Intro: Drake talking]
Yeah
I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time, like
What it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
I can probably tell you a lil somethin' now

[Verse 1:]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap
It's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like (vocalizes)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring 07
Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is whack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say ""my baby's famous and I knew it""

And it wasn't nothin' to it
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out

[Drake: Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF

[Singing:]
Closer to my dreams (Miss Andreena Mill)
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it in my sleep (Sing it to 'em baby)
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2:]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home

[Chorus]

Closer to my dreams
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams


[Outro]
You know what it is man
It's ya boy, D-R-A-K-E
I'm almost there, yeah"
Stunt Hard,Heartbreak Drake,2009,"[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (yeah)
If I ever disappear (look), best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again (yeah)
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 1: Drake]
I tell her, I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, ""Who is he?""
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better than your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully I'll let them see what they say that I'm gon' be
And if not then I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet than to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane, pick a lane, that's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve, without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah, the Chris Paul of this fall
Sittin' this tall, I float high, goodbye, I will miss y'all

[Chorus: Drake & Lil Wayne]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear (yeah), best believe I'm comin' back
Stunt hard (I'm leanin')
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
If I don't do nothin', I'mma stunt my ass off
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil
You can't get on my level cause I am so unleveled
I'm a young rebel and I got a babyface
I need a young Pebbles, I need a stunt double
Yeah, me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles
Yeah, I stick my landin' in a freak drawers
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes
Yeah, but I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O, yeah
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious
Yeah, I'm on the cup of that tilt
And if you hatin' on me I'll say fuck you like wilt
Yeah! I'm a wilderbeast. You're just a wildebeest
My two fingers make a gun, shoot and kill ya peace
Yeah! Talkin big big shit
I am rude, I take food from a kid picnic nigga
Yeah and we can bang like bumper cars
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars, haha

[Chorus: Drake & Nutt Da Kid]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (haan)
If I ever disappear ('bout time)
Best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard (they'll know)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (yeah, okay)
All I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 3: Nutt Da Kid]
I stunt hard, I stunt harder
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans
I ball hard, So I'm a ball hogger
And I go hard in my dunk like Vince Carter
I hustle harder, I live in the Carter
I think forward, all I see is tomorrow
I need meat I'll turn your shop into a horror
So if you tryin' to see more, better feed me
I'm back on my grizzy like ""Izzy"" after ""gr""
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur
And the feds will never get me like a backwards password
Black spur, ghost I'm like Pacman, Casper
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin' over the banister
Ask her, am I her man? Her answer is yessir
Shit, I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA 'bout a quarter a day
Now tell them bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear, best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again, all I ever do is stunt hard"

[Hook]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 1]
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again (Six-six-six!)
Soon as you get in

[Hook]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 2]
Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go

[Hook]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you"
My Side,If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late,2015,"[Intro]
Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like, fo real
This life shit is everywhere, you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take you down through there
Make me wanna take you down through there
I'll take it there

[Hook 1]
Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things
That don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man

[Verse]
Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

[Hook 2]
And you don't ever come to where I stay
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man"

Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in
Man, I got a blunt, can I get a light? Yeah
I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like ""You took the summer off? We couldn't tell""
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it, somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it, ah!

Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

[Verse 2]
Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these women
They don't even know (WOOO)
Buncha' out of season women fuckin' off-season niggas
To get last season wardrobe (WOOO)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw (WOOO)

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go

Let her know I read it though, voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, ""nigga you already know""
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin up the angles now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four, five chains, man the gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, ""the first mill gon' change you""
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together

Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East 'cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out, the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones

Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen

You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy, peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon

You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'

On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker
Boys playin' Playstation

Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

[Intro 2: Drake]
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

It's gonna take some getting used to (what you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (what you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (what you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
Y'all don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
Y'all don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together—motherfuckers got they shoes tied together

[Verse 1]
Always felt like my vision been bigger
Than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers
Out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you?
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you

Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl
But how 'bout now?
'Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now?
'Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now, yeah
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah

Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas

I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl""
You be like ""oh, word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now?
'Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then

This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything

[Bridge: Drake]
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk, are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do"

Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags

I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

[Verse 1]
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package

In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is

Haven't left the condo for a week now

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy (Watch that)
Get hurt, boy (Get hurt)

Ahh, that's the worst, boy (Worst)

You can really get the business (Get it)

Rolling swishers, hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it (Naw)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (Why?)
You too worried 'bout the bitches (What you worried 'bout?)
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it (Try a ting)

6PM in New York,If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late,2015,"[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to ""R.I.P."" about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it

[Outro]
Yeah, gotta love it
*Laughs*
Yeah"

You & The 6,If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late,2015,"[Intro]
Rider shit

[Verse 1]
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, ""I heard you back with you know who""
I told her, ""girl, I'm always back with you know who,"" yeah
And she like, ""Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice

[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah
Hard labor let me pay the price

[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life"

I'ma tell you like this, nigga

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I got a hundred Gs on my line
I ain't eatin' Jacksons when I be in Overtown
Bitch I'm eatin' lavish, look up, ho, it's snowin' now
I just throw the cabbage, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League gon' hold it down
Got a odor there in the attic, that's a couple pounds
New Rolex that I ordered, that's a hundred thou'
Time to milk the game, bitch I went and bought a cow
My nigga GDK a goon, he'll gun you down
Slid up on him with the stick, yeah and sat him down
My nigga Nut so slick, they ain't pat him down
I got a hundred niggas on my line
A hundred squares at a time, nigga, hold it down

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack

[Verse 2: Drake]
Alright my patience runnin' thin
Olympic pools of money, I'm just glad I learned to swim
Cannonball, bitch, I hope your diving board's sturdy
And I hope when dinner's cold, my niggas do not desert me
Nah, but shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And these haters pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person, man I wish y'all would
I say you lucky if your father was a figure
Cause my uncle was my father and my father was my nigga
And my mother so proud cause his son is gettin' bigger
I took time to load the bullets, now I'm 'bout to pull the trigger
Like boom, boom, boom, I'm a genius, god dammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Skinny told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
Yeah, nd to my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname Starter-Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other lames is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like

Addicted to money, addicted to chips

Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga

Yeah, October Firm in the cut
Stay at the top like I'm stuck
That's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack
Virginia Black
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts?
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back

They want me gone, out of the picture
Bury me now and I only get bigger

I'm so hot, yeah, I’m so right now
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I gotta do mansion 'cause I outgrew condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two

Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

Can’t Have Everything,More Life,2017,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy but I'm still the man, come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands, then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17

[Chorus: Drake]
Want a lot, can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything

[Verse 2: Drake]
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

[Chorus: Drake]
Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything

[Verse 3: Drake]
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, ""Are we straight?""
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face, watch with the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area

[Outro: Sandi Graham]
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high."

You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me

[Chorus: Drake]
Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah

Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way"

Lose You,More Life,2017,"[Intro: John Taylor & Drake]
I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun""
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything

You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?""
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, ""Poor me""

Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary

Passionfruit,More Life,2017,"[Intro: Moodymann]
Hold on, hold on, fuck that. Fuck that shit. Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute. Fuck that shit. Still on this mothafuckin’ record. I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all. Ayy, y’all get some more drinks goin' on, I'll sound a whole lot better.

[Verse 1]
Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won’t mention for now
’Cause we're fallin’ apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can’t blame you, no, no

[Verse 2]
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Madiba Riddim,More Life,2017,"[Chorus]
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

[Verse 1]
God knows it
Pure mind and pure soul I possess, He knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken

[Pre-Chorus]
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

[Chorus]
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

[Verse 2]
People change, I'm not surprised
Devil's working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have tried

[Pre-Chorus]
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

[Chorus]
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you

Teenage Fever,More Life,2017,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?

That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?

That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Would you comfort me?

That your love would be untrue

Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
Greaze, so don't forget to remember me (yeah)
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see (get me)
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me?

Pull up in the whip with the gasoline (greaze!)
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine (jheeze!)
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now it's my world, you can have the scene

More time with family and friends. More Life.
 
I've still got vibrations to send. More Life.
 
They say that we could live forever
 
At night I pray it's true

But if someone should come collecting

Sooner than we're all expecting
 
At least the life you lived was one for you

0 to 100 / The Catch Up,NBA 2K16 Soundtrack,2014,"[Produced by Boi-1da, Frank Dukes, Noah ""40"" Shebib, & Nineteen85]

[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Part II: The Catch Up]

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah

[Verse 2]
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up"
The Motion,Nothing Was the Same,2013,"[Intro: Drake]
It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Then their phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Outro: Sampha and Drake]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
(Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion)
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah"
Wu-Tang Forever,Nothing Was the Same,2013,"[Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib]

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure (yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure"

Own it
It's yours
It's yours

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it

Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it

Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and

[Verse 2: Drake]
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in, ha!
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a ""sorry""
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, it's yours, it's yours, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, baby, own it, it's yours, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit"
From Time,Nothing Was the Same,2013,"[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Outro: Baka]
""Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting

Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these

Connect,Nothing Was the Same,2013,"[Intro: Shawn Lawrence]
""There’s 3 balls and a strike. Here's the pitch. It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!""

[Verse 1]
Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with ""this time will be different""
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time

[Chorus]
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
Yeah, swanging

[Verse 2]
She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself""
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

[Chorus]
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
I'll be here, just swanging

[Verse 3]
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, ""You drive my whip like it's yours""
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

[Outro]
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous
I know I'm late it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl"
The Language,Nothing Was the Same,2013,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Look, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement  just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do.""
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do.""

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with you back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do.""
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do.""

[Outro: Birdman & Drake]
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, big time
Sunshine, tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga – stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it"
Tuscan Leather,Nothing Was the Same,2013,"[Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

[Verse 2]
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

[Outro]
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us"

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Beat Switch]

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to"

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us
The homie said ""Hov, it ain't many of us""
I told 'em ""Less is more, nigga, is plenty of us""

[Chorus: Timbaland]

Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 4: Drake]
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg"
Too Much,Nothing Was the Same,2013,"[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh
(Don't do that..)

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'"
All Me,Nothing Was the Same,2013,"[Produced by Key Wane]

[Intro: Aziz Ansari]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested(Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do"

Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?

Yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same

[Verse 1]
Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through

Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through

[Verse 2]
Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do

Worst Behavior,Nothing Was the Same,2013,"[Produced by DJ Dahi]

[Verse 1]
Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see am I finished

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us

Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

[Outro]
Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us

And they never will

[Verse 1]
But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like oh well
You're like, ""Fuck it. Oh well""

Okay I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business

You told me 'bout the picture, now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

Bad Meaning Good,Room for Improvement,2006,"[Verse 1: Slakah]
Lady, you say I stay in the house til four
We don't even go out no more
Its always the same eh
Always complainin
Its obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby
And people are shady

[Bridge: Drake]
My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at

[Hook: Drake]
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[Verse 2: Slakah]
Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next
Lend me ya kleenex

Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you
I hope that I see you again... again
Hope that I see you, see you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is

Thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good"
City is Mine,Room for Improvement,2007,"[Verse 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim

[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo

Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

Ho, yeah, uh huh

Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her

[Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)

[Hook]

[Alternate Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

AM 2 PM,Room for Improvement,2006,"[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck

[Hook: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!

S.T.R.E.S.S.,Room for Improvement,2006,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
It's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But

[Hook: Nickelus F]
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 2: Drake]
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a ""nigga""
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist

[Hook: Nickelus F]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna question half the places Nick been

Extra Special,Room for Improvement,2007,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah. Ho!
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance

[Hook: Drake]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change

[Hook: Drake x2]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'mma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own

[Hook: Drake x2]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh

Special,Room for Improvement,2006,"[Intro]
Uh yeah man, VO
Back again like we never left huh
I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh

[Hook]
(Yeah man; yeah)
You can't just love me like they do
(Talk to 'em V; I need somebody special in you girl)
I need someone special in you

Cause you never know how people stick around
(Uh)
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 2: Drake]
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh

(Yea; uh)
You can just love me like they do
(Vo we back man; Its a beautiful thing dog)
I need someone special in you
(Uh; I'm looking for somebody special man I'm serious; Ho!)

(Yeah; You never really know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
Special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh

(Yep; ho!; Were makin history right now man)
You can't just love me like they do
(Yea; And you a legend for real, ima give you that man)
I need someone special in you

Drake’s Voice Mail Box #3,Room for Improvement,2006,"[Message 1]
Hey, yo, Drake, you never answer your goddamn phone, huh? Pick up the phone, man. I know they got you running around, bro. Anyway, it’s all good with Socrates hooking you up, dawg. Hey, best wishes for this tape. I hope you take over the world. You know we gon' do it. You make sure you get me on there. You call me when you need that hook, you call me when you need that beat, you call me when you need that [hot 16], bro, and let’s put this whole mathematics together, dawg. Once again, it’s a whole gang from Room for Improvement, so we about to be taking over this year, right? Riiight

[Message 2]
Yo, Drake. What up? This is Keeyaga, your boy here. Umm, I don’t know why you’re not picking up the phone, you’re probably out, you know, talking to Lindsay Lohan, or will be talking to her eventually. But, yo, check it out, it’s your boy Keeyaga. I’m just calling to say what up, haven’t talked to you in forever, indefinitely. You know, we need to go, you know, downtown Toronto, kick it together and do what we gotta do, but, uh, I gotta, you know, get off the phone because I have, you know, Beyoncé, you know, even Mendes all on the other line. So, yo, do what you gotta do, and holla at your boy man. All the best. Peace"
Come Winter,Room for Improvement,2006,"[Drake talking]
Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen

[Verse 1: Drake]
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like ""Where's my hi?""
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!

[Drake talking]
Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow

[Verse 2: Drake]
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says ""I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat""
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!

[Drake talking]
Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is

[Verse 3: Drake]
And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime

[Bridge (Drake talking)]
I miss you, most of all, my darling [Beat fades out]
(give me a second to gather my thoughts)
[Fades back in] Strolling in the park (Ho!)
And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)
(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)
(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)

[Verse 4: Drake]
I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive

[Voice]
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring"
Do What You Do,Room for Improvement,2006,"[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 1]
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 2]
Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Bridge]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do"
A Scorpio’s Mind,Room for Improvement,2006,"[Intro: Nickelus F]
Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day

[Verse 2: Drake]
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, ""I expected this""
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy"

Pianist Hands,Room for Improvement,2006,"Thank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it.

I can make them easily admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh

Uh, yea, get in my Slick Rick mode
N'a mean?, I'm a tell ya a Story real quick

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a

[Hook]
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a...
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same

And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[Verse 2: Drake]
My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin' directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it
I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill

Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position

[Drake: speaking]
And I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
Say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
Accept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
You know as a person man. I love to see my black women strong, single
Independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
Video you n'a mean? its a wonderful thing baby. so uh, don't hate me for
This one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? cuz its like uh
And she beautiful and honey dances
And you always downtown making money transfers
And anything the color of braces she get excited
She always showing up at these places she get invited
She a video girl"
Make Things Right,Room for Improvement,2006,"[Hook]
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background witcha asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience
(you're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya are part of the speech coz

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm from the city where people be gettin lazy
Litterin in the streets
And the club district is poppin like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers
Money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams
And dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events
Bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot
So girls'll give up the ass

And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
Daffy and bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane
And she back where she was
Right back on the bus
Its a shame cause now at his window
She throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch
You can see thats shes colder
Cuz he doesnt hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her
That he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Now up north theres five artists deservin a listen
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through
Chances are that it ain't you
I singlehandedly carry out what you can't do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in & the out [?]
Whenever I'm out in memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm andreena mill
Japan and brazil, the audience acreaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

[Hook]
If you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background witcha asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin

Thrill Is Gone,Room for Improvement,2006,"Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy Omar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot
With the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Alisha lately
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh

Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
Circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like Macgyver
Cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple a years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh

Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone

Check
And nowadays some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing
Her reputation's in jeopardy
Cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone"
Try Harder,Room for Improvement,2006,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected
People just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
They just wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town

Chorus: (x4)
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try

[Verse 2: Drake]
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to our annual recital here at the U.P.A., Urban Pianist Association. Here is the most talented student in my class, Aubrey Drake Graham. It has taken a long time for him to get to this point. Do not get me wrong, he’s not perfect, but he has come a long way since my meeting with his mother. He has made improvement! So Aubrey, show these people what you got man!

Diplomatic Immunity,Scary Hours,2018,"[Verse]
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

Emotionless,Scorpion,2018,"[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ahhhhhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you

Yeah

[Verse]
All of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces, but there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a—
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my Mali's pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to— Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
R.I.P. my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself"
Finesse,Scorpion,2018,"[Intro]
Yeah, turn everything up
Yeah, oh yeah
Turn everything up a little more

[Verse 1]
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all the–
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time (yeah)

It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind

You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things would get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this

It takes some finesse

He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind"

Too rich for who? Y'all just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
I've never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight, we like to, we like to, we like to—
Yeah, if shit was at a eight, we like to make it ten
1da sent this in, I'm goin' up all the way
I don't like to talk when there's nothin' else left to say (true)

[Chorus: Drake]
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin' play, your trainer is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— (true)

[Verse 1: Drake]
I gotta breathe real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole 'nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only blessed when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin' to (true)
And the product is still the best though
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate man, I had to Copperfield like presto
Voilà, tada (true)

[Bridge: Drake]
Never a matter of ""could I?"" or ""should I?""
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy

All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—

Three Forum shows but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is smokey, y'all stay safe in this place (true)

Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your niggas is pressin' play, your nanny is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— (true)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to go and hit reset, now we here
I been on top for three sets of three years
I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with
I can't fly if I could sit on the wing of that shit (true)
I try to pay it less mind
They been keepin' tabs on me like I'm payin' next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys (true)

[Bridge: Drake]
Yeah, never a matter of ""could I?"" or ""should I?""
Kiss my mom on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side

All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—

Look at you, you mad! You big mad! Haheheh

Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands (after dark)
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

[Verse 1: Drake & Static Major]
Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'
Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (after dark)

Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night (ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, ""Fuck these niggas,"" rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, ""Do anything, but just don't lie to me""
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes

March 14,Scorpion,2018,"[Intro]
Here we go, yeah

[Verse]
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like ""Billie Jean"", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time
And all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at
Or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud
To let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this my G

[Outro]
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man"

We just right there up the road
You could hit it with a stone

'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes

Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm– I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one

No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear

I had her on ice but then
I watched the ice get thin
Now, does she sink or swim?

[Refrain: Future]
Blue faces, I got blue diamonds, blue tint, yeah
Blue faces, I got blue diamonds, blue tint, yeah"
Peak,Scorpion,2018,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Treat you like princess
Rest in heaven, Diana
Piquing my interest
She got peak like Montana
England breeds proper girls
Where are all your good manners?
Reply with pleasantries
Honestly I can't stand ya

[Chorus: Drake]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you thought of me?
Never had me missin' a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap, nowadays it's free
People are only as tough as they phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me

[Interlude: Stefflon Don]
Bitch been with this boy, yeah, for 4 weeks
I told her go on a date
All of a sudden she married
Didn’t say get bloodclaat married

[Chorus: Drake]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you

[Outro: Stefflon Don, Vinessa Douglas & Rhea Kpaka]
— What I'm sayin', in today really at our big, big age if you're gettin' with someone right now and you're linking them for couple weeks, they should know 'This is the girl I kinda want to see' so lemme lock off the ting but obviously in the world that we live in today is not like that
— He is… did that — but obviously it takes time
— You're chattin' shit. First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning, it should be like honeymoon–
— That's what I said, that's what I said! The beginning is always honeymoon season
— Yeah, well you overdo it and he's overdoin' it. Both of you are overdoin' it right now
— Yeah, well, alright"
Summer Games,Scorpion,2018,"[Chorus]
I think you're changin' your mind
Startin' to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now I'd rather know ahead of time
You said ""I love you"" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see you likin' someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

[Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said ""I love you"" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

[Verse 2]
I kept it decent, I kept you sane
I kept it peaceful, don't lie
I kept it decent, even the secrets
Kept it between you and I

[Bridge]
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea- brea

[Chorus]
You said ""I love you"" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said ""I love you"" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done"
Elevate,Scorpion,2018,"[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse: Drake & French Montana]
If you need me, you can't call me, I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (Wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne (haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favorites, it feels amazin' (yeah)

[Chorus: Drake]
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me, I begin to write the thesis
Franny got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marineland, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer, I'ma be tweakin'"
Sandra’s Rose,Scorpion,2018,"[Intro: Sample & Drake]
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of c-notes get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's Rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves

[Chorus: Sample]
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh

[Verse 2: Drake]
Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese
You don't want drama, capisc'?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna' pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

[Chorus: Sample]
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh"
God’s Plan,Scorpion,2018,"[Intro]
And they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yuh

[Verse 1]
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

[Chorus]
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, yuh, wait
I make sure that north-side eat

[Post-Chorus]
And still, bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yuh, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2]
She say, ""Do you love me?"" I tell her, ""Only partly
I only love my bed and my mama, I'm sorry""
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
'Magine if I never met the broskies

[Chorus]
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, ayy, wait
I make sure that north-side eat, yuh

[Post-Chorus]
And still, bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah, yeah
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah"
Is There More,Scorpion,2018,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is ""Where the rest of my commas?""
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?""
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?

[Outro: Nai Palm]
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (feel me)
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing (my heartbeat's racing)
Tempt me, drive me (tempt me)
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly (highly)
It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for you"

Ten of us, we movin' as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old
I promise I'm bridgin' the gap

Already a hood legend, I ain't need no Shyne (woo!)
First Rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah
Stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments
Dope boys, Off-White, lookin' like soft white on 'em
Heh, you know what I'm sayin'?
We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
Live every word that I'm rappin'
Say I lost 90 bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe
Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been
I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like Young
I got your President tweetin', I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed X and let Zimmerman live, shhh, s-streets is done

Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)

Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can’t go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents

Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck

Had a nigga cuffing, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me

I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)

[Chorus: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Most of these things I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around, dangerous, oh, ooh yeah)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')"
That’s How You Feel,Scorpion,2018,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, woo

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind

[Chorus: Drake]
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

[Refrain: Nicki Minaj & (DJ Boof)]
Rule number one, to be a boss-ass bitch (uh-huh)
Never let a clown nigga try to play you (okay)
If he play you, then rule number two (okay)
Is fuck his best friends and make 'em yes men (okay)
And– (Wow, that's how you feel?)

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try and get you off my mind

[Chorus: Drake]
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya

What the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga?! Custom down?!

Say Something,Shock Value II,2007,"This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe

If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy

It's crazy, I can't help it if you feelin' change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change

Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life

You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley

How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit

Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby"
Let’s Call It Off,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, when did you get like this?
Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, ""This just ain't my style""
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile for me, no

[Chorus: Peter Bjorn & John]
Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us

When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before?
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store

Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look, leave me, leave me, I can't fucking stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we 'posed to be together 'til the world end
But I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call, you just tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that? Do that, do that, yeah

Did you agree we should let it be?
And did you agree it's a must?

The money (Money), cars (Cars)
The clothes (Clothes), the hoes

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 1: Drake]
Drizzy
Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2""
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude]
Alright well, um, alright. We... we'll fuckin' figure it out. You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it, you know, makin' it to the top. All the way to the top. Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 3: Drake]
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me ""Shoppin' Bag Drizzy""
Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Drake]
Yeah, I want the money (Money), money and the cars
Cars and the clothes (Clothes), the hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be (Yeah), I just wanna be successful (That's all I want, man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (You gotta tell 'em, Trey)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Interlude: Drake]
Yeah, it's like I, it's like I know what I gotta say
I just don't know... how to say it... to you

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pardon the swag, but bitch, it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearin' bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, ain't that a female dog?
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell, ""God""
Weezy Baby, I go re-al hard
No further details, boy"

[Intro]
One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

[Verse 2]
And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Chorus]
I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow
But I do it to her

[Bridge]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know
I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like, like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone"
Lust For Life,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse]
I'm tryna do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin' rich s'posed to solve that
And these days, women make offers
And who the hell am I to say (No, no, no)?
My ex sendin' late night texts
'Cause she don't know how to let (Go, go, go)
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin' in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear
Sayin' she should be the one I see every time that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Suburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old handprints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux, I don't really give a fuck
And we only gettin' older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
It's funny when you comin' in first, but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last

Throw your ones up in the air for her, oh-oh

Throw your ones up"
Unstoppable,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse 1: Drake]
My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ahem, my name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over-stand me
I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit, like, ""a-la-la-lollipop""
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I freak that pussy better
Better than her gynecologist, ho just
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick, old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damn, all I got is one dick

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Bridge: Santigold]
I got the talk, the beat and bass
Give me one, I'll take it, make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace
I break it, break it you can't stop me in this ra-race

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable

At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations

[Verse 2]
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right, uh

[Verse 3]
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say ""Get it off your chest""
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention"
Best I Ever Had,So Far Gone,2009,"[Intro]
You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

[Verse 1]
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

[Verse 2]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had

[Outro]
Uhh, ah yeah
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah
You know who you are
I got you"
Brand New,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse 1]
This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
Late, late, late, late

[Bridge]
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Show me if this is brand new (Brand new)
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
New, new, new (Brand new), oh, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Uptown,So Far Gone,2009,"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, ""Drake is just a younger you""
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout?
Young Mula, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on"

Little Bit,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse 1: Drake & Lykke Li]
Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinkin' of
But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
'Cause you don't know who I was before you
And basically, to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm

[Chorus: Drake]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you

[Verse 2: Drake & Lykke Li]
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I, mmm

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit in love with me

[Verse 3: Drake]
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a

[Chorus: Drake]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you, oh
Oh, oh"
A Night Off,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone, I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

[Chorus: Drake]
Come right in, set your bag down
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
I been waiting for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So, baby, I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone
'Cause I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top, so let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl, I'm gonna turn the lights off, but keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what we're about to do

Houstatlantavegas,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse 1]
Hey there, pretty girl
You know exactly what you got
And I don't blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the light's so bright
And the money's so right
And it's comin' in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in

Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in

And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go, ""Hey now, now, watch her go down""
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
''Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin', all-star weekend
One hotel room that all y'all sleep in
Housekeeper knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin' right all season
But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

The Calm,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause

[Break]
You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah

[Outro]
Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like
Man"
Sooner Than Later,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse 1]
Uh
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

[Chorus]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever, and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

[Post-Chorus]
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else

[Verse 2]
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long

You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else

[Verse 3]
The girl or the world? You see, someone gotta lose
I thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?
Night's fallin', lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear

[Chorus]
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on

[Post-Chorus]
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else

You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else"
Say What’s Real,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, ""Damn, Drake fly""
And he just be like, ""Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em""
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, ""'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill""
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real

[Outro]
Yeah, that's all I can say"
Ignant Shit,So Far Gone,2009,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!""
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her?
Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read?
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried

Woo, Young Mula, baby

Bria’s Interlude,So Far Gone,2009,"[Verse 1: Omarion]
Even though you're all alone
All alone when I am gone
I just wanna keep you warm
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yeah, yes, I'll be there
'Cause when I'm all alone, I think about your face
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is give all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah

[Chorus]
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me
(Check it out, check it out)
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet
Promise that I won't forget
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, oh, yes, I'll be there, oh
About to board a flight, sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you but I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh

[Chorus]
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me

Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me, fly"
Fear,So Far Gone - EP,2009,"[Intro]
This is why I do this shit
I think they call this ""venting""

[Verse 1]
Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 2]
(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 3]
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me"

Yeah
Uh-huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
On these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 2: Drake]
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenants
And if I said ""I'm goin' in"" then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfuckin' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' winnin'
She said ""I seen it all"", I say ""No you fuckin' didn't""
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said ""I can't feel my legs"", I'm like ""Bitch, me neither""
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard"
Doing It Wrong,Take Care,2011,"[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Hook]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

[Bridge]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Hook]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

[Bridge]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

The Real Her,Take Care,2011,"[Verse 1: Drake]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

[Bridge: Drake]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

[Hook: Drake]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 2: Drake]
They keep telling me don't save you, if I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right, then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other

[Bridge: Drake]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last; Tunechi

[Hook]
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them ""that ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies"

Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good… You still working?
Tonight… Right now? Did I go out?
Yeah, I went out, I went…
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit…
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious…

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say…

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say…

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 3: Drake]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
""Well, I'm sorry.""

Tell me, have you heard that lately?

You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back

We gonna be in some trouble, trouble"
Over My Dead Body,Take Care,2011,"[Chorus 1: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, ""Why do you worry?""
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1]
I think I killed e'rybody
In the game last year, man, fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
At a strip club, mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning

[Refrain]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Chorus 2: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 2]
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?

[Refrain]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]

Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, ohh
Oh, They loving the crew

Good Ones Go (Interlude),Take Care,2011,"[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

[Chorus]
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

[Verse 2]
But don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh

[Chorus]
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long"

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, please don't do it
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2]
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake, girl, don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is about to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know

Tell them I apologize, it happened over time

[Skit]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over, how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family and struggle and it takin' forever
About hearts that you’ve broken and ties that you’ve severed
No doubt in my mind, that’ll make them feel better"
Look What You’ve Done,Take Care,2011,"[Produced by Chase N. Cashe and Noah ""40"" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cus when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Outro: Drake's Grandmother]
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that. So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you..."
Hate Sleeping Alone,Take Care,2011,"[Verse 1]
She says ""kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me""
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic don’t I? I get it poppin’ don’t I?
I’ll end up stopping won’t I? And by the time I end up stopping
You’ll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don’t lie
She’s losing it right now, 'cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit - I put you back in your place
She tells me ""I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face""
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone"
Under Ground Kings,Take Care,2011,"[Produced by T-Minus and 40]

[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see straight, I can't even see it straight
Uh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot but I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
I swear, it's been 2 years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, ""Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah""
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance
Sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper
That's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don’t do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah, I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)"
Take Care,Take Care,2011,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost"
Make Me Proud,Take Care,2011,"[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you—

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine

It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is

Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says ""I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things""
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your ""Mr. Perfect""
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

HYFR,Take Care,2012,"[Intro: Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives
Could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop
There's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom
Confusing me with questions like...

[Hook: Lil Wayne (& Drake)]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
(And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street, got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib, goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine
We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine

[Verse 2: Drake]
Used to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man
You keep talking that, ""You was this and you had this""
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, ""you're such a dog"", I said, ""you're such a bone.""
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, ""show me some""
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time

Yeah! Drizzy, yo' turn, nigga!
Take Care of the business, nigga (shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business, nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck 'em, we don't love 'em!

I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill, uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, ""Light one, pass it like a relay""
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Hook: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

[Hook: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day

Lord Knows,Take Care,2011,"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Choir & Rick Ross]
And I know the sun will rise with me (huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me (huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me (I got it now) (huh!)
And I know the sun will rise with me
All we wanted was an opportunity
(Just Blaze!) Lord knows!

[Verse 1: Drake & Rick Ross]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (woo!)
Places they say they've been, we actually going for real (woo!)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping (woo!)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy (woo!)
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (huh!)
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Huh! You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal
(M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink (huh!)
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (woo!)
Villa on the water with the wonderful views (views)
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews (Jews)
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss (huh!), came to buy the bar (huh!)
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (woo!)
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R (woo!)
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Everyday them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae (Anna Mae)
I run the gang but the ladies think I'm running game (running game)
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate (fornicate)
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothing short of great (huh!)"
The Ride,Take Care,2011,"[Intro]
I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me man, I hate that shit
It’ll be a long time before yall feel me, if ever
Fo real

[Verse 1: Drake]
You won’t feel me until everybody
Say they love you, but it’s not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass keep getting thicker than a plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It’s feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, nigga

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride

[Verse 2]
You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride

[Verse 3]
I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I’m driving right up to it now
Make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping M’s and sipping dirty jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I’m bout to fuck and I’m just praying that it feels good
I really don’t know much but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my nigga don’t believe it
I mean, sure, there’s some bills and taxes I’m still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches
Still scorching as if I didn’t notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
I’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldn’t fuck with my freshman floater (flow ta)
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it
My juniors and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga

Thank Me Now,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Hook]
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now

[Verse 1]
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up the scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
That's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around

[Chorus]
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now

[Verse 2]
Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up
Soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full
But you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game
In which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position

[Chorus]
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now"
Miss Me,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Verse 1: Drake & Bun B]
I said ""Tell me what's really goin' on""
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said ""If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em""
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Suwoo if you bangin', motherfucker!

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa"
Light Up,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: ""Nobody's workin' as hard as you""
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

[Chorus: Drake & Jay-Z]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Ayy Guru tell, tell homegirl to open that Ace right there...)
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Oww, hoes turn they heads like owwwls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flowin', I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
Mm, I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money — this'll do

[Chorus: Drake]
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go"
Find Your Love,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Verse 1]
I'm more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart, (Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 2]
I'm more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another (Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember and—

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 3]
It's more than just a mission (Hey, hey, hey)
You hear, but you don't listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (Hey, hey, hey)
And get what you've been missing

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Bridge]
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart"
9AM in Dallas,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Verse]
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, ""I guess it does"" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, this what yall want

[Intro]
Young Money

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 2]
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over"
Up All Night,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying ""you should quit"", cars saying ""fuck your life""
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Drizzy say get her, I'ma get her
I got the kind of money, that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch, you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like ""yes"" and you like ""no""
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj & Drake]
I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch (uhh)
Aww, aww, aww
Aww yeah we in this bitch
Aww, aww, aww

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww"
Shut It Down,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Intro: Drake]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you...

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus: Drake]
Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

[Interlude: Drake & The-Dream]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
Ki-Killa, Killa

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in the Louboutins
What you want, what you need
I can be your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

[Chorus: Drake & The-Dream]
And together we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice (they'd know) they'd notice (they'd know)
That we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
Every time we come around, round, round
And they'd notice (they'd know) they'd notice
You shut it down

[Bridge: The-Dream]
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

[Verse 3: Drake]
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

[Chorus: Drake & The-Dream]
You shut that thing down, you shut it down (down, down, down)
You shut it down, you shut it down (down, down, down)
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
You shut it, ohh
And they'd notice, they'd notice

[Bridge: The-Dream]
You looking good girl, go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl, go, go, go, go go go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not trying to say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

[Outro: Drake]
Lay you down, down, down
I’m trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Trying to lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it"
Karaoke,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Produced by Francis and the Lights]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

[Verse 2: Drake]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

[Verse 3: Drake]
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope that you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

[Outro]
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose"
Cece’s Interlude,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Verse 1]
All night I've, been staring, can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know

[Chorus]
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

[Verse 2]
I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy

[Chorus]
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

Unforgettable,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Intro]
Let me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I haven’t slept in days and me and my latest girl agreed
To go our separate ways, so I’m single
Thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just

[Chorus: Young Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city
With my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing
(Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say ""for life"" y'all say ""forever""
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’ma need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talkin' his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life her name's the game

[Chorus: Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city
With my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing
(Cause I'm tryna be unforgettable)

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
Got this top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah, unforgettable
You’ll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable

Show Me a Good Time,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right

Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 2]
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)"
Fireworks,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip blogs want to cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh

[Verse 3: Drake]
Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh"

Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh

Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Well, aren't you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, figure they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like “Voilà!” You do it right he just might buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, triple-white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?

Atlanta girls, let me see your hands (Yeah)
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends (Come on)
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends (Come on)
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big

Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Showtime)
Go, go, go, go, go (As we proceed)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?

Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? (Fancy)"
The Resistance,Thank Me Later,2010,"[Intro]
Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I, I, I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go

[Verse 1]
Should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
""It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!""
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say ""You promised me you would never change""
""You promised me you would never change""

[Verse 2]
Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit ""redial"", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say ""You promised me you would never change""
""You promised me you would never change""

[Verse 3]
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over"
Omertà,The Best In The World Pack,2019,"[Verse]
Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah"

Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

[Verse 2: Drake]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)

Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face

Keep the Family Close,Views,2016,"[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro: Girl (Spoken)]
Any time people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it

Weston Road Flows,Views,2016,"[Intro]
One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t how it always seems when it’s so together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

Yeah, that's right, yeah"
9,Views,2016,"[Intro]
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Outro]
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am...."

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

U With Me?,Views,2016,"[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass

But I'm one year older than my lil homie

But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action

That boy light as Michael Jackson

Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies

Redemption,Views,2016,"[Intro]
Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn
I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted

Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 3: Drake]
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Summers Over Interlude,Views,2016,"[Intro: Majid Al Maskati]
Ooh, baby, yeah

[Verse: Majid Al Maskati]
Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same

[Outro: Majid Al Maskati]
Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know

Views,Views,2016,"[Intro: The Winans]
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
Yeah"

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?

Loving You No More,Young Sweet Jones 2,2010,"[Intro: Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love (ooh)
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive from love (ooh yeah)
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Refrain: Diddy]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try

[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried
But all for nothin' I’m afraid to say
Oh

Lovin' you no more

I love you more than I love myself (no, woah)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be loving you no more (no, no, baby)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin' to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now it's changed
My life, ain't the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me

I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, no, baby) (Drizzy baby, uh uh)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everythin' that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure

[Bridge 2: Dirty Money]
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Can't you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, lovin' you no more)
I love you more than I love myself (no, no)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, woah)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more (oh, no)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (just wanna love you baby)
I love you more than I love myself (just wanna love you baby)"
What If I Kissed You,Young Sweet Jones 2,2010,"What if I kissed you right now
How would we explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
If we were a secret how long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
...away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine

What if I kissed you right now...

Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off of our shoulders
Tell on me
I dont mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie...

...admit that I'm yours
I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions

If we were a secret
Tell me could u keep it?
Keep it your yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
...away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine

What if I kissed you right now
What if I kissed you right now

Just be mine (just be mine)
And u just be mine.. all mine
And u just be mine (just, just be mine)
And u just be mine.. all mine"
I’m Ready For You,Young Sweet Jones 2,2010,"[Drake]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I'm ready for ya

Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soakin in your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No options for, you sayin no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, what you waitin fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

[Interlude]
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah I hear you talkin, don't know who you tryin to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you bein a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

[Drake]
Nothin on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please
[Interlude]

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah I hear you talkin, don't know who you tryin to flatter

Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

[Drake]
Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you wanted fast? Define fast
Cause I could speed it up and make it lastAnd I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm wit it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed tooPlus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready too, hope it's somethin that you thought about

[Interlude]
