Think Good Thoughts,Comeback Season,2007, yeah 9th wonder dont judge me man they tend to say that us rappers are materialistic they say we lack substance me te and el bout to prove em wrong though uh we know what youre thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but yall dont really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date claim were early and be showing up extra late love but yall dont really know me like you think you know me they dont be saying how im humble im hella nice or that ive been approached to sign to roc a fella twice they just tell you all the rumors they heard and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like amel and bryce my groove theory is that when you too cheery they try to bring you down to the level they at well when they are all unhappy then it gets a little sticky thats why i am little nicky to these devils in rap but uh they aint thinking drake get smart girl nah they probably think ill break your heart girl haha i cant lie you probably right about it and if you give me the ass quick ill probably write about it but i hate it when they judge me on how i sound i mean i spit that influential shit from my town i dont know why you sitting on the couch when you see i got a bed bring your ass here and lie down you think taking your purse off will lead to me you taking shirts off and then your skirt off at least i got status because i couldve been a local emcee and you probably wouldve been worse off so ima take this hat off and ima hit it till im back soft and then i backs off cause you thinking you can predict what happen you the reason im thinking im getting sick of rapping uh we know what youre thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but yall dont really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date claim were early and be showing up extra late love but yall dont really know me like you think you know me you probably think i walk around with my gun tucked and swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks well you can think what you want but i think youve been watching too much bet uncut you need to get real and check out my real life i aint a tip drill dont care what it smell like but if you feel like putting all your notions aside and talking to a real nigga id gladly oblige first name phonte id be pleased to date ya college educated got degrees in papers but im from the south where if you aint snapping or rapping bout trapping yous a freak of nature such an anomaly speak so well and talk so collegy such an astonishing contrast to all the bullshit youve been following on behalf of them i offer my apologies maybe with me youll unlearn putting all niggas in a box of concerns me cause i aint dumb shit im well read like sunburn and after me youll never leave no stone unturned uh we know what youre thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but yall dont really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date claim were early and be showing up extra late love but yall dont really know me like you think you know me yeah they say you never judge a book by its cover though you appear as materialistic just like the others so i followed your words to take em in and i dont see what you saying so they coming off paper thin thats when i felt that i would need to do more than just look you up and down to see if i could read you and try to get inside your head only not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me so what i learned on my path to discover your story took one ugly turn after another i saw we wasnt on the same page i wouldve gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way so now im closing the case you only out for the paperback thats written all over your face no el will never judge a book by its cover until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under uh we know what youre thinking love you think we out smoking and drinking love pushing big whips chains clinking love but yall dont really know me like you think you know me we know how you speculate thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date claim were early and be showing up extra late love but yall dont really know me like you think you know me

Come Winter,Room for Improvement,2006, yeah this dedicated to canada man the whole up north a lot of people dont realize how cold it gets during the winter but listen i met this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now its december im driving and shes like wheres my hi its weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summers caught hoin the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snow ing and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties yeah man its a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls yknow wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since im driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesnt answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat shes bold but i roll with it im impressed cause shes sweet then she says i heard your song and im obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but im obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good theres a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this im kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and its kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin and now my heart attached im thinkin off i shouldve been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho yeah uh i told yall i had a story for you right uh ya man its what it is and now im proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but my boy say im actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone imma hold here down tell everyone im the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and its dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana and its a shame she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drakes committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and wed assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different its a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin crack is a one man sport instead of dress up i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin the face the breast the bras the toes im still solo and a long night draws to a close cause its a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside well never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well its like a classified its what im lookin for to carry me through yet i cant seem to find it every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least theres some room to ride theres also room for improvement as soon as june arrive strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring
